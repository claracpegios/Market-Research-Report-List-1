<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Black Pellets Market primarily includes two types of processing methods: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen, leading to a denser, energy-rich product with improved combustion properties. In contrast, steam explosion utilizes high-pressure steam followed by rapid decompression, breaking down biomass structure and enhancing digestibility and energy content. Both methods effectively convert raw biomass into black pellets, which serve as sustainable, renewable energy sources for various applications, including power generation and biomass co-firing.</p></p>
