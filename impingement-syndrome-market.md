<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impingement Syndrome Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structural Impingement</li><li>Functional Impingement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Impingement syndrome can be categorized into structural and functional types, influencing the market for treatments and diagnostic tools. Structural impingement involves anatomical abnormalities, such as bone spurs or irregular joint shapes, leading to restricted movement and pain. In contrast, functional impingement arises from muscle imbalances, poor posture, or improper biomechanics, affecting joint function without structural damage.
